# mime-type-typescript

This tool grabs the latest mime type list from iana's website and parses them to a neat Typescript union-type type declaration of all possible mime-types that you can then use in your projects.

## Usage

Either copy the latest type declaration from `dist/latestUpdate.ts` or clone this repository and run `npm i` and then `npm run update`.
